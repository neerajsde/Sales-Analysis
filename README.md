# Super Store Sales Analysis

![Super Store](link_to_your_image_here)

## Overview

This repository contains the code and visualizations for my Super Store Sales Analysis project. In this project, I used Python and data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn to conduct an in-depth analysis of sales data from a Super Store.

## Project Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored sales trends over time, analyzed geographical patterns, and identified key product categories.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Investigated sales variations on a yearly, monthly, and daily basis.
- **Geographical Insights:** Explored sales patterns across different regions, states, and cities.
- **Product Analysis:** Identified the most popular categories, sub-categories, and individual products based on sales.
- **Customer Focus:** Analyzed the purchasing behavior of top customers.
- **Payment Mode Distribution:** Visualized the distribution of payment modes used by customers.

## File Structure
